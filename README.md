# Image Manipulation Detection using Error Level Analysis (ELA)

## Introduction

This project aims to detect image manipulation using Error Level Analysis (ELA) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The model is trained on a dataset of real and fake images, converting them into ELA images to highlight discrepancies introduced by manipulation. The primary goal is to classify images as either real or fake based on their ELA features.

## Running Instructions
